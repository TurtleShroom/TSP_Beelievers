		<description>On Old Earth, living beings' ownership of other living beings as chattel did not stop with men owning animals, or even men owning men. Animals are capable of it too! There exists a rare adaption among insects where they will capture animals of other species and compel them to work for them, complete with killing them if they escape and perpetual brainwashing. This is called "dulosis," literally "slave-making," and is a form of facultative, social, brood parasitism. It occurs most commonly among the slave-making ants, of which dozens of species exist. However, dulosis has also beeen recorded in bees, and it is these bees of which are made use all over the galaxy. Slaver Bees kidnap the larvae (babies) of other insects (especially other bees) and use them to produce honey to keep them alive. Drones' sole purpose is to drive these slaves, or kidnap more larvae of other species. \n\n\n\n\n Bee Traits: \n\n 	Production time: 48 hours \n 	Works at Night: No \n 	Works When Raining: Yes \n 	Unusual Sources Needed: No \n 	Minimum Temperature: 29.3ºF (-1.5ºC) \n 	Maximum temperature: 122ºF (50ºC)</description>
